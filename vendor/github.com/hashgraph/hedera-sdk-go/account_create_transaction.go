// AccountCreateTransaction creates a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt,
// or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically
// generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 25 hours. Records are generated for
// any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged hbar for each record generated, so the
// thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions.
//
// The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and creates everything in shard 0 and realm 0,
// with a null key. Future versions of the API will support multiple realms and multiple shards.

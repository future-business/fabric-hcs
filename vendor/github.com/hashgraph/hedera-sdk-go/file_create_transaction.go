// FileCreateTransaction creates a new file, containing the given contents.  It is referenced by its FileID, and does
// not have a filename, so it is important to get and hold onto the FileID. After the file is created, the FileID for
// it can be found in the receipt, or retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to
// be created, and retrieving that.
//
// See FileInfoQuery for more information about files.
//
// The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and creates everything in shard 0 and realm 0, with
// a null key. Future versions of the API will support multiple realms and multiple shards.

// AND for create/modify, OR for delete. This is useful for acting as a revocation server. If it is desired to have the
// behavior be AND for all 3 operations (or OR for all 3), then the list should have only a single Key, which is a

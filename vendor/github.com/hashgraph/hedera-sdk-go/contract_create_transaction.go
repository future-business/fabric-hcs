// ContractCreateTransaction starts a new smart contract instance. After the instance is created, the ContractID for it
// is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be
// created, and retrieving that. The instance will run the bytecode stored in the given file, referenced either by
// FileID or by the TransactionID of the transaction that created the file. The constructor will be executed using the
// given amount of gas, and any unspent gas will be refunded to the paying account. Constructor inputs come from the
// given constructorParameters.
//
// A smart contract instance normally enforces rules, so "the code is law". For example, an ERC-20 contract prevents a
// transfer from being undone without a signature by the recipient of the transfer. This is always enforced if the
// contract instance was created with the adminKeys being null. But for some uses, it might be desirable to create
// something like an ERC-20 contract that has a specific group of trusted individuals who can act as a "supreme court"
// with the ability to override the normal operation, when a sufficient number of them agree to do so. If adminKeys is
// not null, then they can sign a transaction that can change the state of the smart contract in arbitrary ways, such as
// to reverse a transaction that violates some standard of behavior that is not covered by the code itself. The admin
// keys can also be used to change the autoRenewPeriod, and change the adminKeys field itself. The API currently does
// not implement this ability. But it does allow the adminKeys field to be set and queried, and will in the future
// implement such admin abilities for any instance that has a non-null adminKeys.
//
// An entity (account, file, or smart contract instance) must be created in a particular realm. If the realmID is left
// null, then a new realm will be created with the given admin key. If a new realm has a null adminKey, then anyone can
// create/modify/delete entities in that realm. But if an admin key is given, then any transaction to
// create/modify/delete an entity in that realm must be signed by that key, though anyone can still call functions on
// smart contract instances that exist in that realm. A realm ceases to exist when everything within it has expired and
// no longer exists.
//
// The current API ignores shardID, realmID, and newRealmAdminKey, and creates everything in shard 0 and realm 0, with
// a null key. Future versions of the API will support multiple realms and multiple shards.
